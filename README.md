# Org

This will be the repo where we can store administrative documents (to-do, guidelines, policies). It should not contain much code, if any at all.

Repos should exist per code-base. Explanation of what is where should be in this repo.

You can use your own git user to contribute to all of this. Marcel just did that right here.
When you are a collaborator, you can do this without forking first. Shown here.

Contact Marcel Haas (m.r.haas@lumc.nl) or ELAN.dcc (ELAN.DCC@lumc.nl) if anything is unclear or if you need a repository for your project!
